Mapping
=======

Amiss uses the ``Amiss\Meta`` class to represent an object's table mapping. Amiss uses
implementations of ``Amiss\Mapper`` to create this object. Several complete options for retrieving
this metadata are provided, as well as facilities for rolling your own mapper if you prefer.

The annotation mapper is used throughout this documentation.
