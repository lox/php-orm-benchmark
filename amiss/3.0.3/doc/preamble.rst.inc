**Amiss** is a Data Mapper and Active Record implementation for MySQL and PHP
5.3 or greater.

**Amiss** does not try to be a fully-fledged ORM that cooks you breakfast, walks
the dog and gives your schema its daily back massage, it only tries to take
the monotony and repetition out of retrieving simple objects and simple
relationships from a database that already exists.

Its not the fanciest ORM on the block, but its brutal simplicity may make it a
better candidate for your next throwaway project or prototype than PHP's
premier ORM behemoth `Doctrine <http://doctrine-project.org>`_, the dated
interface of `Propel <http://www.propelorm.org/>`_, or the tight coupling of
your favourite framework's own model layer.

It is unapologetic about being `stupid, simple and fast`.
