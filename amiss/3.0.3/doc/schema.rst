Table Creation
==============

If you're feeling really, really lazy, you can use ``Amiss\TableBuilder`` to create your tables for
you too. This is a *very limited tool* and is not intended to do anything other than spit out some
fairly generic initial tables.

Once you have declared your object, you can then either tell the ``Amiss\TableBuilder`` to create
the table in the database directly, or emit the SQL for you to use as you please:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class Artist
    {
        /** @primary */
        public $artistId;

        /** @field */
        public $name;
    }

    $builder = new Amiss\TableBuilder($manager, 'Artist');
    $sql = $builder->buildCreateTableSql();
    $builder->createTable();

See the ``Field Mapping`` section of :doc:`mapper/mapping` for details on how Amiss knows what types
to use for fields.


Crappy Command Line Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a crappy command line tool available in the Amiss distribution at ``bin/amiss``. The
following commands will help turn a set of classes into a sql schema:

* `bin/amiss create-tables-sql`: emits sql to the command line
* `bin/amiss create-tables`: creates the tables in your DB
* `bin/amiss create-classes`: creates classes from an existing database

All of the scripts will output usage information when run with no arguments.

You can filter the classes by namespace or by annotation for both of these commands. Searching by
annotation will allow you to include only classes that have the class level annotations you specify.
For example, you can set your classes up like so:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    /** @foobar */
    class Thingy {}

    /** @bazqux */
    class OtherThingy {}

    /** @dingdong */
    class NopeThingy {}


And then pass the following arguments to either command ``--note foobar --note bazqux``, and only
the ``Thingy`` and ``OtherThingy`` class will be used.

You can run commands using the demo from the root of the Amiss distribution like so::

    bin/amiss create-tables-sql --engine mysql --namespace Amiss\\Demo doc/demo/model.php
    bin/amiss create-tables --dsn 'sqlite:/tmp/foo.sqlite3' --namespace Amiss\\Demo\\Active doc/demo/ar.php

.. warning:: 

    I messed up - I hacked in arg parsing as I wanted to avoid the syntax errors ``getopt()``
    misses, but it doesn't support arguments that use ``=``. The following will work: ``--engine
    mysql``, though this will not: ``--engine=mysql``. It's stupid, I know. I'll fix it at some
    stage.
