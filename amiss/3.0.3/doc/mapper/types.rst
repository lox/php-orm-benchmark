Type Handlers
=============

Amiss doesn't care what type a value is by default. It will assign whatever the database gives it
on retrieval, and bind whatever you give it on query.

This may be fine for 98% of your interaction with the database (trust me - it really will be), but
then along come dates and throw a whopping big spanner in the works.

How are you persisting dates? Probably as a YYYY-MM-DD formatted string, yeah? Maybe as a unix
timestamp? But when you're working on them in PHP, you really want them to be a `DateTime
<http://php.net/manual/en/book.datetime.php>`_ instance. No, really, you do.

``Amiss\Mapper\Base`` provides a facility for handling specific database types arbirtrarily. Any
class which inherits this class (including the :doc:`annotation`) gains this support.


Quickstart (annotation mapper)
------------------------------

Define an object with a field that has a ``@type`` annotation:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class Foo
    {
        /**
         * @field
         * @type mydate
         */
        public $bar;
    }


Assign a handler for the type:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $mapper = new \Amiss\Mapper\Note();
    $mapper->addTypeHandler(new \Amiss\Type\Date(), 'mydate');


Now all fields with ``@type mydate`` will pass through the ``\Amiss\Type\Date`` class on both
retrieval and storage.


Using Type Handlers
-------------------

In order to register a handler with Amiss and allow it to be used, you need to either assign it
directly by key to the ``Amiss\Mapper\Base->typeHandlers`` array, or if registering the same handler
to many types, using ``Amiss\Mapper\Base::addTypeHandler($typeHandler, $id(s))``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // anything which derives from Amiss\Mapper\Base will work.
    $mapper = new Amiss\Mapper\Note;
    $dateHandler = new Amiss\Type\Date;
    $mapper->addTypeHandler($dateHandler, array('datetime', 'timestamp'));


Type handler IDs are always lower case, even if the field type contains uppercase letters. The base
mapper will also ignore everything in your field type definitions following the first space or
opening bracket

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class Foo
    {
        /**
         * @field
         * @type BAZ(QUX)
         */
        public $bar;
    }

    // this will apply for field $bar
    $mapper->addTypeHandler($bazHandler, 'baz');


Included Handlers
-----------------

Amiss provides the following type handlers out of the box:


Date
~~~~

.. py:class:: Amiss\\Type\\Date( $withTime=true, $timeZone=null )

    Converts database ``DATE`` or ``DATETIME`` into a PHP ``DateTime`` on object creation and PHP
    DateTime objects into a ``DATE`` or ``DATETIME`` on row export.

    :param withTime: Pass ``true`` if the type is a ``DATETIME``, ``false`` if it's a ``DATE``
    :param timeZone: Use this timezone with all created ``DateTime`` objects. If not passed, 
        will rely on PHP's default timezone (see 
        `date_default_timezone_set <http://php.net/date_default_timezone_set>`_)


Encoder
~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: Amiss\\Type\\Encoder( callable $serialiser, callable $deserialiser, $innerHandler=null )

    Allows a value to be encoded/decoded using a pair of callables. This is useful if you want a
    specific type to be passed through PHP's ``serialize``/``unserialize`` function pair, or through
    ``json_encode``/``json_decode``, or your own custom translation.

    .. code-block:: php

        <?php
        class Foo
        {
            /**
             * @field
             * @type myEncodedType
             */
            public $nestage;

            /**
             * @field
             * @type mySuperMunge
             */
            public $munged;
        }

        $encoder = new \Amiss\Type\Encoder('serialize', 'unserialize');
        $mapper->addTypeHandler($encoder, 'myEncodedType');

        // or this terrible example demonstrating closures
        $encoder = new \Amiss\Type\Encoder(
            function($value) { return "--$value--"; },
            function($value) { return trim($value, "-"); }
        );
        $mapper->addTypeHandler($encoder, 'mySuperMunge');


    ``Amiss\Type\Encoder`` can also be passed a secondary handler that will be applied after the
    encoding/decoding process occurs. ``Amiss\Type\Encoder`` instances can thus be chained, or used
    in conjunction with other handlers.


.. _embed:

Embed
~~~~~

.. py:class:: Amiss\\Type\\Embed( $mapper )
    
    Allows one or many objects that are managed by Amiss to be stored as a nested value. This is
    useful when using Amiss with the Mongo extension, or when you are ok with storing a complex
    document as a serialised blob in a relational column (I am, sometimes).

    The ``Embed`` type places additional requirements on the type name - it must be followed with
    the name of the class that is to be embedded, and an optional ``[]`` if the embedded value is  a
    collection. In the following example, we add a type handler for a type called "nest" that will
    embed one ``ArtistType`` object:

    .. code-block:: php

        <?php
        class Artist
        {
            /**
             * @field
             * @type embed ArtistType
             */
            public $artistType;

            /**
             * @field
             * @type embed Member[]
             */
            public $members;
        }

        $embed = new \Amiss\Type\Embed($mapper);
        $mapper->addTypeHandler($embed, 'embed');


    .. warning::

        When using Amiss with MySQL or SQLite, this must be used in conjunction with the
        ``Amiss\\Type\\Encoder`` type as these data stores can not handle storing or retrieving
        objects as column values directly.

        .. code-block:: php

            <?php
            $embed = new \Amiss\Type\Embed($mapper);
            $encoder = new \Amiss\Type\Encoder('serialize', 'unzerialize', $embed);
            $mapper->addTypeHandler($encoder, 'nest');


Custom Type Handlers
--------------------

To create your own type handler, you need to implement the ``Amiss\Type\Handler`` interface. This
interface requires three methods:

.. py:function:: prepareValueForDb( $value , $object , array $fieldInfo )
    
    Take an object value and prepare it for insertion into the database
    

.. py:function:: handleValueFromDb( $value )
    
    Takes a value coming out of the database and prepare it for assigning to an object.


.. py:function:: createColumnType( $engine )

    This generates the database type string for use in table creation. See :doc:`/schema` for more
    info. You can simply leave this method empty if you prefer and the type declared against the
    field will used instead if it is set.

    This method makes the database engine name available so you can return a different type
    depending on whether you're using MySQL or SQLite.


The following (naive) handler demonstrates serialising/deserialising an object into a single column:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class SerialiseHandler implements \Amiss\Type\Handler
    {
        function prepareValueForDb($value)
        {
            return serialize($value);
        }

        function handleValueFromDb($value)
        {
            return unserialize($value);
        }

        function createColumnType($engine)
        {
            return "LONGTEXT";
        }
    }


To make use of your new handler, declare an object with fields that map to your handler's ID and
register the handler with your mapper:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class Foo
    {
        /** @primary */
        public $fooId;

        /**
         * @field
         * @type serialise
         */
        public $bar;

        /**
         * @field
         * @type serialise
         */
        public $baz;
    }

    // anything which derives from Amiss\Mapper\Base will work.
    $mapper = new Amiss\Mapper\Note;
    $mapper->addTypeHandler(new SerialiseHandler(), 'serialise');


Now, when you assign values to those properties, this class will handle the translation between the
code and the database:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $f = new Foo();
    $f->bar = (object)array('yep'=>'wahey!');
    $manager->save($f);


The value of ``bar`` in the database will be::

    O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:3:"yep";s:5:"wahey";}


And when we retrieve the object again (assuming a primary key of ``1``), ``bar`` will contain a
nicely unserialised ``stdClass`` instance, just like we started with:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $f = $manager->getById('Foo', 1);
    var_dump($f->bar);
    

In the situation where you want to handle a specific database type (like ``DATETIME`` or
``VARCHAR``), you can provide a handler for it and simply leave the ``createColumnType`` method body
empty.

To determine the id for the handler to use, it takes everything up to the first space or opening
parenthesis. In the following example, the type handler ``varchar`` will be used for column ``bar``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class Foo
    {
        /**
         * @field
         * @type VARCHAR(48)
         */
        public $bar;
    }
    $mapper->addTypeHandler(new BlahBlahHandler, 'varchar');

.. note:: Handler ids are case insensitive.
