MongoDB Helpers
===============

`MongoDB <http://mongodb.org/>`_ is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database. PHP 
has excellent support for Mongo via a well maintained 
`PECL extension <http://pecl.php.net/package/mongo>`_.

Amiss builds on that support by offering a simple way to convert the nested arrays returned by the
PECL extension into graphs of domain objects.

.. note::

	This support is still in its infancy. It may need some kinks ironed out, extra features
	added or missteps corrected. Please visit the `issues page <http://github.com/shabbyrobe/amiss/issues>`_
	with any suggestions.
